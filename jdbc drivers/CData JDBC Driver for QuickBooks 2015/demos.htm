NOTE: These projects are mostly simple demos, and by no means complete applications.
They are intended to illustrate the usage of the CData JDBC Driver for QuickBooks in a
simple, straightforward way. What we are hoping to demonstrate is how simple
it is to program with our JDBC driver. If you want to know more about it, or if
